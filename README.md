This is the code I made with Lien Aeyels for a schoolproject. 
In C++ we made the code for an Emergency center, which has sensors. Each of these sensors, when activated, 
give a specific action. For example, calling the police, or the fire brigade. 
Sensors can always be added or deleted. And there is an overview that can be made from the master class.
In this project we made use of a Compostite design patern. 

We used, inheritance, smart pointers, ... . 

This was our first big project in C++.
